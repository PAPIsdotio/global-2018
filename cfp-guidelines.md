# Call for Proposals

PAPIs is the international series of community conferences dedicated to **real-world Machine Learning applications**. Previous editions took place in London, São Paulo, Sydney, Barcelona, Paris, Valencia, and this year's global edition will be held in Boston for the 3rd consecutive year. Engineers, managers, scientists, hackers and researchers will meet to share experiences and discover the latest innovations, techniques and tools to build ML applications. Find out more at [papis.io/2018](http://www.papis.io/2018).

## Key dates

- **July 1 (23:59 ET)**: Call for Proposals closes
- **July 16**: Notifications of acceptance/rejection due
- **September 16**: Lightning Talk and AI Startup Battle application deadline
- **October 16-17**: Conference takes place in Boston

We'd like to **strongly encourage women to submit proposals**. As a community conference, we think it's important to increase diversity in AI. Applications for funding to reimburse childcare and travel costs will be invited from women and primary carers whose proposals are accepted. We're also looking for [sponsors](http://papis.io/sponsoring) to support our diversity efforts!

## What we're looking for

### Presentations

We're looking for presentations with a practical mindset, on a wide range of experience levels — from beginner-friendly how-tos to cautionary tales to deep dives for experienced professionals. We welcome non-technical content, but also strongly encourage very technical presentations.

We'd like to hear about:

- Challenges and lessons learnt in integrating ML into various applications/products/processes and new areas; this can include technical and domain-specific challenges, as well as those related to fairness, accountability, transparency, privacy, ethics, etc.
- Failure stories — you aren’t a real ML innovator until you’ve had to deal with massive failure of your ML system!
- Techniques, architectures, infrastructures, pipelines, frameworks, APIs to create or improve intelligent applications (from embedded to web-scale)
- Design of ML-powered products
- Tools to make it easier to integrate ML into real-world products/applications (with demos)
- Exciting and innovative ML use cases
- Hands-on tutorials that teach a specific and valuable skill

We’re looking for a diverse and creative line-up of speakers, preferably with experience in public speaking. We invite them to submit proposals of **20' long, non-commercial presentations** (5' for Lightning Talks). _(Note: we also have a very limited number of sponsored speaking slots — [contact the sponsorship team](mailto:sponsoring@papis.io) for more information on how to secure one.)_

#### Tips and rules

You can find tips on how to craft a good proposal, how to submit it, and some rules [here](https://github.com/PAPIsdotio/general/blob/master/cfp-tips-rules.md). We will be receiving several proposals covering the same topics. They will be blind-reviewed by our Program Committee and evaluated on the basis of their novelty and/or significance and/or clarity of presentation. Reading these tips and rules will help you craft a proposal that stands out and increase its chances of getting accepted.

### Papers

We welcome technical papers, industrial experience reports, review papers and research papers. While submitting a paper is no requirement to be accepted to present at PAPIs, we highly encourage authors to take the time to share their work in this format as well. Papers presented at PAPIs are published in **[Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/)**.

Get more information about the submission process [here](https://github.com/PAPIsdotio/general/blob/master/cfp-tips-rules.md).

### Startups

PAPIs hosts the world's 1st startup competition where participants are judged by an AI on stage — not a human jury. We're looking for new startups that have AI / ML at their core. Selected startups will be able to present and exhibit at the conference. Applications should be made via a separate platform (To Be Announced).

## We’re looking forward to receiving your best proposals!

If you have questions or if you have not heard about the status of your submission, please [contact us](mailto:program-committee-2018@papis.mailclark.ai).
